# Presidential weight

This project investigates the sensitivity of phrasal stress to syllable weight using the President's corpus.
Our first step is to load in a syllabified and weight annotated version of CMUDICT and inspecting its structure.

```{r cars}
dictionary <- read.delim('clean_sylcmu.txt', sep=',')
head(dictionary)
```
